                    Damn Vulnerable Serverless Application (DVSA) is a deliberately vulnerable application aiming to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help developers better understand the processes of securing serverless applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about serverless application security in a controlled class room environment.
                    The aim of DVSA is to practice some of the most common serverless vulnerabilities, with a simple straightforward interface.
                    Please note, there are both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.
