# LESSONS
This tutorial assumes the reader has basic knowledge of serverless and security concepts. It is recommended to first review the [OWASP Serverless Top 10 project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Serverless_Top_10_Project) and the [report](https://github.com/OWASP/Serverless-Top-10-Project/), reviewing common weaknesses in serverless architecture.

Please also note that this tutorial covers only a *small portion* of the vulnerabilities that exist in the DVSA. There are **dozens more vulnerabilities and scenarios** that are not covered in the tutorial and you are *encouraged* to find **and document** more vulnerabilities that you find.

Good luck!
